## About the design:
### Features:
Capacitors that work part of the circuit momentarily as the battery dies out or is being changed\
A vibrating motor controlled by a pushbutton\
Four LEDs, with a potentiometer to control the brightness between two of them\
Potentiometer to control the total current to the circuit
### Does not feature:
- Art on the front
- Button for anything but the motor
- A backup battery slot. Good luck with replacing the batteries the moment they die out.
- A door. Yes, it is in a castle shape, but it is missing the gate or door.
- Waterproofing. Don't try to put a moat around it. Again, it's in a castle *shape*, not a real one.
### How to build the circuit:
Order the PCB and its components, then assemble it according to the images and KiCad files
### Components:
1 X coin cell battery holder\
4 X 5mm Light-Emitting Diodes\
5 X 220Ω resistors\
2 X 10 µf capacitors\
1 X 2N3904 NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor\
1 X 6mm SW pushbutton\
1 X mini vibrating motor disk\
1 X photoresistor\
2 X Potentiometer
